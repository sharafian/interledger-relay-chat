## Overview

ILRC is a chat protocol that rides on top of the Interledger stack instead of
the Internet stack. Using the STREAM protocol to multiplex data and money, ILRC
allows any message to be paid.

ILRC comes with a server and a client implementation.

## Protocol Definition

ILRC is based on a JSON protocol, which differentiates it from IRC (based in plaintext).
